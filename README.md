# KoalaLightGBM

Microsoft's gradient boosting machine learning package
[LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM) is here wrapped for
use in the [Koala](https://github.com/ablaom/Koala.jl) machine
learning environment. It is built entirely on top of Allard van Mossel's
julia wrap [LightGBM.jl](https://github.com/Allardvm/LightGBM.jl)
of the Microsoft software.

### Usage example:

In the following example we start with the hyperparameter
`validation_fraction=0.2` to obtain a running validation score for the
training run. This means 20% of the data in rows `train` is held back
in training for the validation scoring. Then we train on the full
`train` set

````julia
julia> using KoalaLightGBM
julia> using Koala
julia> const X, y = load_boston();
julia> const train, test = split(1:length(y), 0.8); # 80:20 split
julia> rgs = LGBMRegressor(validation_fraction = 0.2,
num_iterations=100,
num_leaves=2, min_data_in_leaf=12)
LGBMRegressor@...312
	
julia> mach = Machine(rgs, X, y, train)
SupervisedMachine{LGBMRegressor,}@...392

julia> fit!(mach, train)
SupervisedMachine{LGBMRegressor,}@...392

julia> mach.report
Dict{Symbol,Array{Float64,1}} with 1 entry:
:rms_raw_validation_errors => [1.53358, 1.4901, 1.46696, 1.42826, 1.41359,â€¦
	
julia> score = err(mach, test)
5.626761247184338
    
julia> rgs.validation_fraction=0 # so fit! trains on full train set
julia> fit!(mach, train)
SupervisedMachine{LGBMRegressor,}@...392
	
julia> err(mach, test)
3.6908332199941105

### Categorical features

By default, KoalaLightGBM treats any feature of element type `T<:Real`
as an ordinal feature, and this includes columns of `Bool` and `Int`
type. If a feature is to be treated as categorical, first convert it
to some non-real type (such as `String` or `Char`). Alternatively,
modify the default transformer for inputs as in the following example
continued from above:

````julia
julia> tr_X = default_transformer_X(rgs)
julia> tr_X.categorical_features = [:Rad, :Chas]
julia> mach = Machine(rgs, X, y, train, transformer_X = tr_X)
````

Now the features `:Rad` and `:Chas` are interpreted as categorical
wheneever `mach` is fit.
